# Cephalus

*a neural OS*

## Introduction

Cephalus is a NOS (Neural OS). It serves as a way to harness the use of
multiple sensors and a learned internal state representation to accomplish 
tasks of fixed or indefinite duration within a shared environment. Tasks 
can offer feedback to the system to hone the state representation. Because
the environment is shared among tasks, each task can benefit from the
improvements to the state representation made at the behest of other tasks.
