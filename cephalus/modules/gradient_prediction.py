# TODO: This is where all the interesting stuff goes. Look at rltd_gp.hand_coded_solutions and
#       'Temporal Differences for Infinite-Horizon Backpropagation.md' in the RLTD project, and
#       the various approaches evaluated in the related 'GradientEstimation' and
#       'RewardInducedGradients' projects for ideas. Also take a look at the 'RLAgents' project for
#       general design ideas. Once the different approaches are coded here, we'll need to run some
#       tests to compare their performance.
